The usability study conducted on the Balenciaga website aimed to identify and address common usability issues encountered in the luxury e-commerce platform. Through a thorough analysis, several key findings were identified, each accompanied by proposed solutions to enhance user experience and streamline the purchasing process.

Task 1 findings focused on improving interactions related to adding items to the cart and inclusion of the "Shop the Look" feature for convenient purchasing. Additionally, aesthetic enhancements were suggested for the menu design to improve visual appeal and navigation clarity.

Task 2 findings highlighted the importance of case sensitivity in the search bar text and the introduction of a "Customers Also Bought" feature to facilitate product discovery and increase user engagement. Consistency in cart visibility was also addressed to provide users with clear visibility and maintain consistency.

Task 3 findings emphasized the significance of simplifying the feedback process to encourage user engagement and improve communication between users and website administrators.

By implementing the proposed solutions, such as introducing easy-to-use controls, including features like "Shop the Look" and "Customers Also Bought," and streamlining feedback processes, the Balenciaga website can significantly improve usability, enhance user satisfaction, and align with industry best practices in luxury e-commerce.
